# arduinoTemp
Home project starting from a simple thermometer

This project is implementing basic functionnalities od the Arduino using sensors and devices.

The setup started with using a DHT11 sensor (temperature and humidity) ans displaz the values on a liquid display.
The setup evoled with the addition of a thermistor MF52 supposed to give more accurate temperature values than the DHT11.
